            <p>The Island has a tranquil and sleepy atmosphere,
                 making it a delightful place to relax and enjoy 
                 the spectacular set, sweeping beaches, 
                 rolling sand dunes and warm Indian Ocean. 
                 The ocean continues to play a vital role in the 
                 life and livelihood of Lamu,
                  and old-style sailing dhows abound.
                  A trip on one of these wooden boats offers a highly 
                  calming way to explore the area,
                 travelling to neighboring islands and fishing villages.Nyali
                 Located across the creek from Mombasa, Nyali is Kenya's most 
                 metropolitan beach. Happily, though, the lack of high-rise 
                 hotels and urban traffic makes it feel farther away from the 
                 big city than it really is.
                 Behind the long white-sand strip lie upscale beach homes and 
                 resorts like Whitesands and the Serena. The coral reefs and sea grass 
                 meadows of Mombasa Marine National Park are ripe for exploration by scuba or snorkel.
                 There are also plenty of urban distractions here: Malls and supermarkets,
                  butterfly and crocodile farms, Hindu temples and even a golf course.
